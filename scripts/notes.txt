singularity becomes more active as it heats up

say that for every x unit of heat, the activity increases by y

y activity
_________
x heat

multiply by current heat to get the singularity activity

if the rate is (0.01 / 10 = .001), the activity would be 1 at 1000 heat

take coolant algorithm at 100% to see reasonable-ness

(0 - 1000) = -1000
-1000 * (1.5 * 1) = -1500
